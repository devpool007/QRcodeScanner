# qr_code_scanner

A new Flutter project. This is my first flutter project it is a custom made QR Scanner for a college event.

**Features**
It scans only a set of QR_codes and only scans them once to avoid plagiarism
It is a very basic implementation if you wanna implement it to your event just enter the QR code urls int the list in main.dart file and run the project :)
